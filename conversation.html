okay?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Yeah, I need to, I have, I think I have ADHD.</p><p>So I cannot write and, and, and concentrated the same time.</p><p>So I will go back a little bit.</p><p>So you have a Shopify store.</p><p>So, competition analysis is something that can interest you.</p><p>Like, I don't know who your wife considers competition or is she watching after competition?</p><p>Yeah, I mean So we have local competitors, kind of, I think she's probably the gorilla in town as far as it's hard to.</p><p>Imagine anybody else is doing as much business as we are.</p><p>They could be but I don't see the infrastructure in place for them to sell.</p><p>What they need.</p><p>You need quite a bit of storage and stuff to do the kind of numbers we're doing so, but they Vlad there is, but there is competition.</p><p>I think the bigger thing is to, and we're going to a thing next month.</p><p>I think they have a brick and mortar store to, but they have an online store, and they're going to also let us kind of tore their warehouse, so we're hoping to get some tips there.</p><p>But I think the bigger thing we're trying to figure out and improve is online store because our brick and mortar is only 2,000 square feet.</p><p>And unless we open another store we're kind of tapped.</p><p>Out on how much we can sell out of there, but you have enough storage, you have enough storage.</p><p>So we up until the end of this month, we have 3,000 square feet.</p><p>So to 1500 square foot sweets, or warehouses.</p><p>The landlord wanted us to sign another three years or minimum two years, and we want to buy a building.</p><p>So we just kind of Decided not to do that.</p><p>So, we have to be out of one side of it, by the end of the month, but we rented storage units to put everything in.</p><p>It's just a hassle to use those.</p><p>So you have software that runs the inventory.</p><p>How do you want inventory?</p><p>Everything, everything is through Shopify and then kind of so, shopify's weakness on a, how much, you know about them, but not so much.</p><p>I think they're out of Canada.</p><p>I think that was how it started and I think the guy who started it, My dog.</p><p>I think the guys start it was trying to run his own online business and was pretty frustrated with what existed out there.</p><p>So he was software engineer and grab somebody's, and they just kind of threw something together, okay?</p><p>And but the, the origination of it, and the focus of it has always been online store, okay?</p><p>And then a few years ago, I mean, we have been using it for six years.</p><p>No, five years.</p><p>They have a point of sale, we had used square up till then, you know, somewhere.</p><p>What do we want of sale is their platform?</p><p>They have their own point of sale platform.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>And square, was it?</p><p>What is it?</p><p>What is it?</p><p>So square is if you ever go somewhere, and they swipe your card in that little square with a little square reader, or they have full systems, they had a really slick easy-to-use point of sale if you weren't like doing bark.</p><p>I mean, you could do bar codes, but we were just starting out.</p><p>We were handwriting all our tags and which is super easy to use.</p><p>But as we got bigger and more technical We needed something to tide into a website, and we had tried doing a website to other Times Square's, like, oh, we have a website.</p><p>It's through Weebly, which is kind of like a third party.</p><p>And I am like, no, no, no.</p><p>So that's when we made the leap to Shopify because they do a really good job on a website, that's their strength, and they have a point of sale which is their weakness for the cell system kind of sucked initially.</p><p>They continue to improve it.</p><p>But all that being said, You pay a membership thing for the Shopify.</p><p>You get quite a bit of tools in there, but if you want to add capabilities, you have to buy this app and that app and this app.</p><p>Okay, question.</p><p>How much, what's the base payment to Shopify?</p><p>I don't like 80 bucks a month or something, and then they dig includes new point of saying, well, they take a day, take a hit on every sale just like everybody else does.</p><p>Oh, whatever you sell from the online store, you give them a percentage.</p><p>So we're paying 100, I guess they increase their pricing 105 a month.</p><p>Hmm, 2.6 percent Plus 30 cents for any online and in-person is 2.5 percent.</p><p>What's in person point of sale?</p><p>Like, you know, brick and mortar.</p><p>When they come in the shop, we're getting charged 2.5% on any credit card purchase.</p><p>And then we have apps that were paying for.</p><p>I can get all that for you, but yeah, what's up to pay for mean what do you need those apps?</p><p>Is it something?</p><p>Well, we have an app that does that tell us when we're our stocks getting low since it's a daily email that's only 3 bucks a month and it works kind of crappy.</p><p>So again I think you will appreciate this because you know the industry we both came from or still part of, but what I think happens with these apps is my kids would call me racist for saying it, but I think it's these Indian software programmers that are looking for some, some side money.</p><p>And so they write these apps.</p><p>And get a couple of their buddies and barely support it.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>But you know, you can email them.</p><p>And better reports allows us to basically grab all the data and put it in a report.</p><p>You can do all that manually through the back into.</p><p>Shopify is just pretty ugly.</p><p>So better reports is an app and that one's probably seen.</p><p>That's 3990 a month.</p><p>There's one called picky story which is someone were to buy a product T' by this hat and it says you know people that buy this hat, buy this shirt products recommendation, right?</p><p>And it's a fancy way and an AI way.</p><p>I think they're going in, sometimes it's good.</p><p>Sometimes it's not great, but they're recommending.</p><p>And so that was 160 bucks a month we - 160 models.</p><p>Yeah, that was crazy but you know if you did you know, the guy?</p><p>Can you quantify it?</p><p>Yeah, you know, not.</p><p>I haven't, I haven't done that.</p><p>Haven't dug in, to be honest and looked at that.</p><p>So everything that you buy, you need to go in and get the information from.</p><p>Where do you get your want to say if you're getting your money's worth?</p><p>Yeah, you should go in and see.</p><p>I mean some of them are giving you a way to get more sales.</p><p>Some of them aren't there's a might turn this one off, but there's a SEO, an image Optimizer, which basically takes your images and kind of shrink them down, so that it loads faster.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I run that every once in a while that ones, 29 a month.</p><p>I mean it just on and on.</p><p>So and that's the problem of Shopify is that, you know, that the entry fee is relatively inexpensive Uncle, when you add all the apps, you know, how much do you get to?</p><p>Well, it sounds like 300 bucks.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>And then the one we use a lot that is also we're hoping and I we have heard rumors that they're going to do more with inventory is called faves, fa VES like favorite faves, 40, And what its main focus is when you go to market, when you go to a wholesale market.</p><p>So she goes to these markets, three, four, maybe five times a year.</p><p>We just went to Vegas last month or this month.</p><p>All your wholesalers are there and in a matter of three days if you're doing what you should be doing, you should be spending somewhere between 100 and 150 thousand dollars cost in three days.</p><p>Well and you're trying to keep track of what you're spending, what?</p><p>Buying.</p><p>And by the third day, you can't remember what you bought on the first day?</p><p>So these apps on your phone only Iphone, they don't do Android but you can take a picture of the piece and you take a picture of the tag, and they do AI again.</p><p>They do some type of texts can of tag and grab the critical information.</p><p>Sometimes it grabs too much or not enough but then that's all in the app and you put in the quantity you put in the wholesale price.</p><p>You put in what you think you're going to sell it for and then when You receive it.</p><p>You can receive it from that app and then it will it has a link and it will send a Shopify, but our hope is because Shopify.</p><p>Doesn't have a really good inventory track, or they have a thing called stocky.</p><p>I will look into that but it sucks.</p><p>We have tried it multiple times, it's just way too many steps.</p><p>So we use this massive spreadsheet with 2,000 line items on it, okay, so anyhow, but if you have this idea of 580 something or some 500, And 50-something products on the website.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>We have more than that in the store.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Miss. Dillon.</p><p>And then it's always new, you know?</p><p>We used to be around 1,000 items on that spreadsheet.</p><p>I haven't checked in a while but I guess it's the only thing stories.</p><p>He's connected with the brick and mortar store.</p><p>Yeah, yeah.</p><p>All the inventory cross-references.</p><p>It's very that part works really, really well.</p><p>I mean, there's there're glitches.</p><p>Has every.</p><p>Once while they do an update, and they don't think things through, and they did an update a couple months ago, for the point of sale system, they have two apps, they have one for the point of sale and walk to the back end.</p><p>And when you get a credit card purchase, when you use their old credit card, chip reader, it will grab the customer name.</p><p>They have a new one that's a tap and Chip and it also does Apple pay, but doesn't grab the customer information, which is kind of critical.</p><p>Both for we're gonna use customers.</p><p>And for turns anyhow, they updated that dumb app and stop taking the customer name.</p><p>And so when a customer comes back with their item, if they don't have the receipt we're screwed, we can't find, you know, so they fixed it but yeah, I am talking in circles but that's okay.</p><p>Yeah, it's pretty powerful.</p><p>I mean, it's what I tell people when they say, hey, I am looking for a point of sale system with the website I say Shopify.</p><p>Hands down.</p><p>It's the best thing that's available today.</p><p>It's not perfect, but it's definitely the best thing so.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>And so, do you get like an analysis of the data of the only products that people buy these kind of?</p><p>So we use a, I can share my screen.</p><p>I can I share my screen.</p><p>Yeah I will give you permission.</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>Try to do it and I will give you permission share screen.</p><p>Stop too.</p><p>That's not what you want to see, or even know what that is.</p><p>Oh, that's a condo association thing.</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>I don't want to see that either, that's our logo.</p><p>All right, I am sure in the wrong screen.</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>I do I see a bunch of tabs but oh, do you okay, okay, okay, good?</p><p>Sorry, hold on.</p><p>Ddddd So I wouldn't share this with everybody because no, just a minute.</p><p>So, don't share it because I probably other guys would see it.</p><p>So just if not, just tell me, so we use another.</p><p>You're gonna, you're gonna think we're crazy with all the money we're spending, but it's it has a purpose.</p><p>Way is another company called management one.</p><p>Well, first of all, let me show you the back end just so you know how Shopify work can you see that?</p><p>Yep.</p><p>Awesome have analytics.</p><p>So this is today's sales or whatever but then go to analytics, you can go into reports.</p><p>It's got everything.</p><p>I mean we use probably 5% of it like automatic reports.</p><p>You can that's what the better reports are going to these apps to play for additional reports.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>So if I go here this is the one that's like 3990, but they have all of these already set up.</p><p>So we use a few of them because we run inventory at midnight, at the end of the month because inventories a point-in-time kind of report that was main reason.</p><p>I bought it, but I really should be using this and my goal.</p><p>All after I retired was to really dig into this, and then we bought the rental house question.</p><p>All this information here in the better report yeah, something that already exists on your other On you, the other panel, they had a dashboard, all this stuff all this?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>You we don't use it.</p><p>I mean the only ones were using are these custom reports up here, okay?</p><p>And by product type and stuff, but we could, I mean, all of this is available to us, I guess.</p><p>All of this is API calls.</p><p>You can use AP tag.</p><p>Yeah, I mean, they're just, they're just basically, you give them permission to have access to the database of your Shopify store.</p><p>Okay?</p><p>So this is Okay, can you go back to the dashboard?</p><p>Yeah, so everything you have here is in that better reports, you have here on your, you have your own, your a meetings that guy was saying earlier, you could manually go in and find all this stuff, like go to reports and you can say, you know, for example, sales by Channel and I do this weekly.</p><p>So my weekly report is I go Monday to Sunday.</p><p>Okay, and then I come over here and I add a few things.</p><p>I want to know what, the average order value is.</p><p>I want to know what our gross margin is units per transaction.</p><p>And I grabbed these numbers and put it and just put them into a spreadsheet, but you don't have it sent to you.</p><p>You have to go in and do everything I do it but I could do it through better reports 5 have my act together.</p><p>Yeah, so okay yeah the other thing we're using but you can't seem to get it to come up.</p><p>But we use a company called management one.</p><p>I will just briefly show you this.</p><p>Just here we go.</p><p>And they are like an Inventory management company advisor, we have our own advisory that we meet with is names Martin, and we do a monthly meeting with him, and they basically turn this into a real company.</p><p>So we See it just pops up correctly.</p><p>That wasn't the one I wanted.</p><p>I am on.</p><p>So you're actually using another data analysis.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>So they so we have everything categorized by product type.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Sorry, I am trying to show you the.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>Google's analytics, merchandise plan, maybe this, is it okay?</p><p>So, alright, PDF.</p><p>Oh, Well, hold on.</p><p>Love you.</p><p>Wouldn't it be better if you can?</p><p>We go, let us go email.</p><p>This will help you and I can send you some of this stuff if you want to just see what we have access to.</p><p>But this is just one screen.</p><p>I mean, they have, there's a better one.</p><p>I like better with all colorized.</p><p>I just didn't pick the right one, but down the left side, you can see all these different categories.</p><p>And clothing, dress, don't worry about history, but casual dressy Dresses, kimono sweaters, jackets, tops habla, everything we sell is categorized.</p><p>Have an open to by meaning when we go to, when we go to our Market, we know what we want to buy, see this one's the one I am talking about, we have to, we have a goal, which we can put into that other app.</p><p>I was telling you about the takes the pictures of the clothing and stuff.</p><p>But, Anyhow, the point I am trying to make is, there's a ton of data.</p><p>That we could be really analyzing a lot more carefully.</p><p>We just have to choose to do it and it's not.</p><p>So you need to go into the software and do it and you don't get like reports every week for the month.</p><p>You have to go.</p><p>Yeah, not from these guys.</p><p>I could, I could get a report on sales and inventory and stuff like that from Shopify if I set it up.</p><p>And these guys now have a direct line to Shopify so their goal.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>This is the one that I am used to using.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>So this one if you look at the top right says, also this is the whole store, their breaks it into clothing and then it breaks it down to dresses.</p><p>So you can go in and look at in this data has inventory, and what your inflow is, what your goals supposed to be.</p><p>What your turmeric is, I mean, c times graphs.</p><p>Not that I would say Well, it has bar charts, but they're kind of useless.</p><p>Yeah, so is something visualize the yeah, something that could help.</p><p>Yeah, I mean the latest thing that we're doing a show you something else.</p><p>This is brand-new that we just started doing and it's a super basic, but hold on.</p><p>Had a Mac for a while but I still can't figure out how to move it from one screen to the other.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>So these are our categories, down the left side, this is our sales plan for the month, for each category and as of Sunday and all I did was take how many days Sunday does a 20 out of 31 days.</p><p>So we should be at about sixty-four percent for the month.</p><p>Even though that's not, you know, the months, not linear, right?</p><p>Fridays and Saturdays are bigger days, but where are we struggling?</p><p>Which categories are struggling that are behind and then I just color coded.</p><p>Um, so But yeah, I mean we could take this data and put it into something more graphical, that might be easier for people.</p><p>But this is like brand-new that we just started doing which we should have been doing, you know, two years ago.</p><p>But so it's like you track your goes through a spreadsheet.</p><p>Well.</p><p>Yes, right now is what we're doing but you know, we could we can find a different way probably but okay, I am pulling.</p><p>I am pulling the sales plan from retail orbit, sorry from management 10 because our consulting company and then I pull the actual sales date or from Shopify.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>And I just do the math in the spreadsheet.</p><p>So I don't you mind me asking how much do you need to pay like All around for all this?</p><p>These softwares so Shopify.</p><p>We talked about, like you said, with the absent, everything you're probably, and we're using a reason klaviyo, which is the email marketing, which is almost stopped sharing this for now, which is a Separate.</p><p>I would say with crap, all the Shopify apps and klaviyo were probably at 400 to 500 dollars a month.</p><p>And then management one that consulting company that has given us this open to buy or calculating it.</p><p>And they're not just taking our numbers, they have all these other boutiques they work with, and they're looking at Trends, and they're trying to predict the future.</p><p>So there's some intelligence there whether you buy into all of it or not.</p><p>And they just up there, right?</p><p>And we're paying them like 1,100 bucks a month.</p><p>It's probably seen ya, but we would have never done this kind of organization without them.</p><p>I think it, I think it took us from almost a million dollar, company Revenue, 22 million.</p><p>We would have never got there on our own.</p><p>So, so that email marketing software, is it not something that Shopify offers?</p><p>No, they have a link to Shopify, but it's why did you tell me?</p><p>Appointment in command in 10 minutes.</p><p>Okay, let us hopefully want everyone that we do know, okay, if it stops can go in again to stop but I will open the link again.</p><p>It's the same limit.</p><p>Same number, same number.</p><p>You can set it up by the way, it's my fault.</p><p>Okay, so and mr5 the first time the same email marketing software is not the same as not Shopify.</p><p>It's like it's separate.</p><p>We did.</p><p>We used a MailChimp for a while.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>But MailChimp doesn't have all the hooks and whistle the, you know, bells and whistles.</p><p>That I don't know if I am saying or clavijo klaviyo.</p><p>How much do you pay for that to software?</p><p>That one is just got a bill on It think that one's like 165.</p><p>Okay?</p><p>I need Loops just Neiman's.</p><p>Oh no, it's crazy.</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>Let us see if I can get logged in.</p><p>It's the preeminent I would say, anybody worth their weight, and we weren't using it but anybody that's trying to do online with a boutique in the u.s.</p><p>Is using this.</p><p>So let me share in the usually doesn't say it doesn't necessarily say that it's the best thing to do.</p><p>What does it have besides the Indians?</p><p>So it has all the analytics behind it, and then you can set up, you know, you can set up all these email automated emails.</p><p>So someone signs up for the email, they're going to get another email from us.</p><p>I don't, to be honest, I don't control this, and so I haven't dug into know what we're doing and not doing well.</p><p>It's pretty new for us some things you'd see many campaigns.</p><p>I don't know.</p><p>Yeah, but it's also a lot of automation.</p><p>So if someone leaves a card abandoned, it will email them, you know?</p><p>It's all the s*** you get from every online company nowadays, right?</p><p>Like hey you know looks like you like that hat and then, you know, we can do whatever we want.</p><p>We can say free shipping.</p><p>If you know we noticed you didn't buy it free shipping if you want to try it you know whatever.</p><p>So does it have.</p><p>Does it have like landing page building and final building?</p><p>I am not sure it has all these flows.</p><p>No.</p><p>Know what I am referring to is I would say if you want to know, I mean I can do.</p><p>So yeah, I just don't have the answers.</p><p>Yeah, yeah.</p><p>It seems, he doesn't have it, but it works with crap.</p><p>See, I don't do this stuff.</p><p>It works with.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>What's the where you can do your templates and do all the graphics Bonza?</p><p>Kansas.</p><p>Yeah, it works with canva very nicely and it's very much tied into Shopify a lot better than MailChimp was so okay.</p><p>But yeah, I would look at klaviyo on your own and tell me if it's missing things, you think?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>So, What, what exactly can you say in your business?</p><p>That takes take you a lot of time.</p><p>And your wife.</p><p>So, Here, let me share again.</p><p>I don't do this work, so I am not the best one to speak to it, but every product if you want it to be online, you have to go in here.</p><p>Even if its a four-dollar.</p><p>Sticker 395.</p><p>You got to go in here.</p><p>You got to take a picture of it.</p><p>Hmm, price.</p><p>You had all these tags over here so that if someone searching for a Yeti sticker it will pop up on this on the website and it we put it into all these collections.</p><p>This is relatively new that we have been paying more attention to this.</p><p>When we paid these guys to update our website, they really helped us come up with better strategies.</p><p>If you look at our old website compared to the new one, we have categories.</p><p>Now it has ability to search a lot more powerful.</p><p>Lee, but it for every single product, new product, you have to do this.</p><p>So I would say that takes a lot of time, and I don't think there's a way quite honestly to automate that much.</p><p>The other thing is at the end of the month, because we're not fully automated.</p><p>It's better, but we have a lady who takes all of our inventory data, all of our sales data, all of our on order data and puts it into a spreadsheet that we upload to management one so that they can then do their magic and check out that color sheet, I was showing you with what the open-to-buy is moving out.</p><p>How much do you pay for this lady?</p><p>We don't pay a lot, but I think she gets paid 20 bucks an hour, so she probably get paid a lot more.</p><p>How much does it take a cheeseball time?</p><p>So she's working you know.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>I will 77290 hours every two weeks so, but she's part of the company it's not.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p>She's an employee something she's our data crazy lady.</p><p>She's the one that made our spreadsheet look so nice.</p><p>Okay, so yeah, I think any way we could automate that It's show you that spreadsheet that I can automate and grabbing the information from Shopify.</p><p>Arranging it in an Excel file and sending to management one.</p><p>Yeah, I mean we get the report from Shopify and I think she's gotten better at like grabbing that from the report, which is spreadsheet-based, you know, CSV or something and dumping it in and it takes her.</p><p>I would have to ask her to be honest, but it takes her.</p><p>I think a couple days to run all those numbers.</p><p>Hmm, maybe not full-time, a couple days because she's doing her other job during that too.</p><p>But, but yeah, there was a way to somehow automate that Be helpful.</p><p>We will have to see what exactly you take from weather and how we can, but it sounds like scraping data from within your system and yeah, and putting in a spreadsheet and then, yeah.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>The rest of the, the rest of the jobs that are just tedious and take time, they're just all physical jobs, right?</p><p>I mean, I am not that cold out all the Clothing and you're steaming it.</p><p>I mean I don't think you can help us with that.</p><p>No, we thought about like setting up like a sauna room and just hanging all the clothes in there and see if they would self get the wrinkles out.</p><p>You know.</p><p>But let us end the meeting and do it again.</p><p>Because it's like, in one minute, it's going to start.</p><p>Give me.</p><p>I will call you back in like two minutes.</p><p>I am going to call my wife back and see if she ain't no worries, okay?</p></div></body></html>
